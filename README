This is a loose collection of scripts and a daemon for visualizing clusto
databases in interesting ways.

viz.py listens on port 9660

Rack visualization
http://localhost:9660/

Pool utilization over time
http://localhost:9660/pool/unallocated

update.py should be setup on a cron at a fairly regular interval (every five
or ten minutes) to gather data from clusto and dump it to pools.db (sqlite)
and result.json, to be read by viz.py

Creating pools.db:
echo "CREATE TABLE counts (
id integer primary key,
name text,
ts int,
count int);" | sqlite3 pools.db
